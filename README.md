# Atari2600
Programs written for atari 2600

To execute these programs you will need to have dasm installed. Dasm can be installed from here: https://dasm-assembler.github.io/

Alternatively, you can download the source files for dasm directly from here: https://github.com/dasm-assembler/dasm/releases (I have used the version of dasm for ARM from this link)


Command for execution:

dasm <filename>.asm -f -v0 -ocart.bin

I'm using the stella emulator for running the programs I write
